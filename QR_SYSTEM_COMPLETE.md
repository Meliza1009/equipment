## 🎯 API Testing with Manual QR Codes

If you don't have a physical QR code, you can test using manual entry:

### **Sample QR Codes:**
```
Equipment ID 1: EQ-1-TEST1234
Equipment ID 2: EQ-2-TEST5678
Equipment ID 3: EQ-3-TESTABCD
```

### **Test with Postman/cURL:**

**1. Validate QR:**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/qr-scan/validate
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "qrData": "EQ-1-TEST1234"
}
```

**2. Borrow Equipment:**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/qr-scan/borrow
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "equipmentId": 1,
  "durationType": "hours",
  "duration": 2,
  "latitude": 40.7128,
  "longitude": -74.0060
}
```

**3. Return Equipment:**
```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/qr-scan/return
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "bookingId": 1,
  "equipmentId": 1,
  "latitude": 40.7128,
  "longitude": -74.0060
}
```

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### **Frontend Issues:**

**Camera Not Working:**
- Check browser permissions (Settings → Site settings → Camera)
- HTTPS required in production (works on localhost)
- Use manual entry or image upload as fallback

**QR Scan Fails:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running on port 8080
- Check JWT token is valid (login again)
- Try manual QR code entry

**Equipment Not Showing:**
- Check Network tab for API responses
- Verify equipment exists in database
- Check operator has added equipment

### **Backend Issues:**

**Validation Fails:**
- Check QR code format (should match: `EQ-{id}-{hash}`)
- Verify equipment ID exists in database
- Check JWT authentication

**Cannot Borrow:**
- Check for overdue bookings
- Verify equipment is available
- Check user eligibility

**Late Fee Incorrect:**
- Verify system clock is correct
- Check due date calculation
- Confirm hourly rate ($10/hour)

---

## 📊 Database Verification

### **Check Equipment:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM equipment WHERE id = 1;
```

### **Check Bookings:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
```

### **Check QR Codes:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, qr_code, available FROM equipment;
```
