# Equipment List & QR Code Display Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Equipment List Not Showing Real Data
**Problem:** The operator equipment page was showing mock data instead of fetching real equipment from the backend.

**Solution:**
- Replaced `mockEquipment` with real API call to `equipmentService.getEquipmentByOperator()`
- Added `useEffect` to fetch equipment when component mounts
- Added loading state while fetching data
- Now shows equipment that was actually added through the "Add Equipment" form

### 2. QR Code Not Showing Image
**Problem:** When clicking the QR button, only the QR code text was shown, not the actual QR code image.

**Solution:**
- Updated `QRCodeDisplay` call to include `qrCodeImage` prop
- Used free QR code API (`https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/`) to generate QR image
- QR image is now generated dynamically from the equipment's QR code data
- Shows actual scannable QR code image (300x300px)

### 3. "Add Equipment" Button Always Showing
**Problem:** Even after adding equipment, the page showed "Add Your First Equipment" button because it was using mock data.

**Solution:**
- Now fetches real equipment from backend
- Shows equipment table if equipment exists
- Only shows "Add Your First Equipment" button when list is truly empty
- Equipment added through the form now appears in the list immediately after refresh

## Changes Made

### `OperatorEquipmentPage.tsx`

1. **Added Imports:**
   ```typescript
   import { useEffect } from 'react';
   import { Loader2 } from 'lucide-react';
   import { equipmentService } from '../services/equipmentService';
   ```

2. **Added State:**
   ```typescript
   const [equipment, setEquipment] = useState<any[]>([]);
   const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
   ```

3. **Added Equipment Fetching:**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     const fetchEquipment = async () => {
       if (!user?.id) return;
       
       try {
         setLoading(true);
         const data = await equipmentService.getEquipmentByOperator(user.id);
         setEquipment(data);
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error fetching equipment:', error);
         toast.error('Failed to load equipment');
       } finally {
         setLoading(false);
       }
     };

     fetchEquipment();
   }, [user?.id]);
   ```

4. **Added Loading State:**
   ```typescript
   {loading ? (
     <div className="text-center py-12">
       <Loader2 className="h-8 w-8 animate-spin mx-auto text-gray-400" />
       <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">Loading equipment...</p>
     </div>
   ) : filteredEquipment.length > 0 ? (
     // ... equipment table
   )}
   ```

5. **Fixed QR Code Display:**
   ```typescript
   <QRCodeDisplay
     qrData={selectedEquipment.qrCode || `EQ-${selectedEquipment.id}`}
     qrCodeImage={`https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300&data=${encodeURIComponent(selectedEquipment.qrCode || `EQ-${selectedEquipment.id}`)}`}
     title="Equipment QR Code"
     description={`QR Code for ${selectedEquipment.name}`}
     equipmentName={selectedEquipment.name}
     onClose={() => setSelectedEquipment(null)}
   />
   ```

6. **Updated Delete Handler:**
   - Now actually calls backend API to delete equipment
   - Updates local state to remove deleted equipment
   - Shows proper error messages if delete fails

## How It Works Now

### Equipment List Flow:
1. Operator navigates to `/operator/equipment`
2. Page loads and shows loading spinner
3. Fetches equipment from backend using `equipmentService.getEquipmentByOperator(userId)`
4. Displays equipment in table format
5. Shows "Add Your First Equipment" only if list is empty

### QR Code Display Flow:
1. Operator clicks QR icon button for an equipment
2. Modal opens showing:
   - **QR Code Image**: Actual scannable QR code (generated via API)
   - **QR Code Data**: The text data (e.g., "QR_123")
   - **Copy Button**: Copy QR data to clipboard
   - **Download Button**: Download QR image as PNG
   - **Instructions**: How to use the QR code

### QR Code Generation:
- Backend creates QR code when equipment is added: `QR_<equipmentId>`
- Example: `QR_123` for equipment with ID 123
- Frontend generates QR image using: `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300&data=QR_123`
- QR image is displayed as 300x300px scannable code

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: View Equipment List
1. Login as operator:
   ```
   Email: operator@village.com
   Password: password
   ```
2. Navigate to `/operator/equipment`
3. Should see loading spinner, then equipment list
4. Equipment added earlier should appear in the table

### Test 2: Add New Equipment
1. Click "Add Equipment" button
2. Fill out form and submit
3. Wait for success message
4. Navigate back to equipment list
5. New equipment should appear in table

### Test 3: View QR Code
1. In equipment list, click QR icon button
2. Modal should open showing:
   - ✅ Actual QR code image (black and white squares)
   - ✅ QR code data (e.g., "QR_123")
   - ✅ Copy and Download buttons
   - ✅ Usage instructions
3. Click "Download QR Code"
4. QR image should download as PNG file
5. Test scanning the downloaded QR code with phone

### Test 4: Delete Equipment
1. Click trash icon for an equipment
2. Confirm deletion
3. Equipment should be removed from list
4. Backend should delete from database

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/pages/OperatorEquipmentPage.tsx` - Complete rewrite with real API integration

## Benefits
1. **Real Data**: Shows actual equipment from database
2. **QR Images**: Generates scannable QR code images
3. **Better UX**: Loading states, error handling, proper feedback
4. **Offline QR**: Download QR codes to print and attach to equipment
5. **Easy Tracking**: Each equipment has unique QR code for tracking

**Status: ✅ FIXED**

Both issues are now resolved:
- Equipment list shows real data from backend
- QR codes display as actual scannable images

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Install `qrcode.react` library for better offline QR generation
2. Add equipment image upload functionality
3. Add edit equipment functionality
4. Add equipment statistics (total bookings, revenue, etc.)
