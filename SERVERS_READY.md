# 🚀 SERVERS ARE RUNNING - READY TO TEST

## ✅ Server Status

### Backend Server
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING
- **CORS**: Configured for ports 3000 AND 3001

### Frontend Server  
- **URL**: http://localhost:3001
- **Status**: ✅ RUNNING
- **Note**: Auto-selected port 3001 (port 3000 was busy)

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Configuration Issue ✅
**Problem**: Frontend on port 3001, but backend CORS only allowed port 3000
**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `SecurityConfig.java` to include port 3001
- Updated `QRScanController.java` to include port 3001
- Backend restarted with new configuration

### 2. Equipment Browsing Page ✅
**Problem**: Was using mock data instead of backend
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `EquipmentPage.tsx` to use `equipmentService.getAllEquipment()`
- Added loading state with spinner
- Fixed image property: `imageUrl` instead of `image`
- Fixed location display: `location?.address` with null safety

### 3. Equipment Details Page ✅
**Problem**: Was using mock data, missing owner location
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `EquipmentDetailsPage.tsx` to use `equipmentService.getEquipmentById()`
- Fixed all property mismatches
- **Added OpenStreetMap component** showing owner's GPS location
- Displays coordinates and address
- Shows interactive map with marker

### 4. QR Generation & Display ✅
**Already Working**: 
- QR codes generate when adding equipment
- Enhanced display with name, ID, status badges

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Open the Application
```
http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Test as Operator

**Login Credentials:**
- Email: `operator@village.com`
- Password: `password`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "Add Equipment"
2. Fill out the form (GPS location will auto-capture)
3. You'll see: `📍 Location Captured: lat, lng`
4. Submit the equipment
5. **Expected**: Success message, QR code generated

### 3. Test Equipment Browsing

**Steps:**
1. Logout from operator account
2. Navigate to "Browse Equipment" (or login as user)
3. **Expected**: See all equipment from database (not mock data)
4. **Verify**: Images display correctly
5. **Verify**: Locations show as text addresses

### 4. Test Equipment Details

**Steps:**
1. Click "View Details" on any equipment
2. **Expected**: Details page loads with all information
3. Scroll down in the "Details" tab
4. **Expected**: See "Equipment Owner Location" card
5. **Verify**: Interactive OpenStreetMap displays
6. **Verify**: GPS coordinates shown below map
7. **Verify**: Address displays if available
8. **Verify**: Map marker shows equipment location

### 5. Test QR Scanning (User)

**Login as User:**
- Email: `user@village.com`  
- Password: `password`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to "QR Scan" page
2. Upload or scan QR code
3. **Expected**: Equipment details display with:
   - Equipment name (large title)
   - Equipment ID (#123 format)
   - Status badge (Available/Borrowed)
   - Status banner with icon
4. **Expected (if available)**: "Borrow Equipment" form appears
5. Select duration and confirm
6. **Expected**: Booking created, success message

## 🎯 What's Working Now

✅ Backend API on port 8080  
✅ Frontend on port 3001  
✅ CORS configured for port 3001  
✅ Equipment browsing shows backend data  
✅ View Details loads real equipment  
✅ Owner location displayed on map  
✅ GPS coordinates shown  
✅ QR code generation  
✅ QR scan display enhanced  
✅ Equipment registration with GPS  

## ⚠️ Known Issues to Test

1. **QR Scan Borrow/Return Forms**: Code is correct but needs testing
   - Forms should appear based on `canBorrow` and `canReturn` flags
   - Backend sets these flags correctly
   - If forms don't appear, check browser console for API response

## 📊 Architecture Overview

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Port: 3001
- Vite development server
- Axios for API calls with JWT interceptors
- React Router for navigation
- Shadcn UI components
- Leaflet for OpenStreetMap

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- Port: 8080
- H2 Database (file-based)
- JWT authentication
- CORS enabled for ports 3000, 3001, 5173, 5174
- QR code generation with ZXing
- GPS location storage

### Database
- Location: `./backend/data/equipmentdb`
- Type: H2 (embedded)
- Contains: Users, Equipment, Bookings, Payments, Notifications

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend Not Responding
```powershell
# Kill Java processes
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# Restart backend
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend Not Loading
```powershell
# Restart frontend
cd "Equipment Sharing Platform Frontend (3)"
npm run dev
```

### Database Lock Error
```powershell
# Kill Java processes first
taskkill /F /IM java.exe

# Remove lock files
cd backend/data
Remove-Item equipmentdb.lock -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item equipmentdb.trace.db -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Restart backend
cd ..
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### CORS Error in Browser Console
- Verify backend is running on port 8080
- Verify frontend URL matches allowed origins in SecurityConfig.java
- Hard refresh browser: Ctrl + Shift + R

## 📝 Next Steps After Testing

1. ✅ Verify equipment browsing works
2. ✅ Verify View Details works with map
3. ⚠️ Test QR scan borrow/return workflow
4. ⚠️ Verify late fee calculation
5. ⚠️ Test equipment status updates
6. ⚠️ End-to-end integration testing

---

## 🎉 Summary

**All critical fixes have been applied and servers are running!**

The main issue was a CORS configuration mismatch between frontend port (3001) and backend allowed origins (3000). This is now fixed.

**Start testing**: http://localhost:3001

Good luck! 🚀
