# Landing Page Update - Authentication Focus

## Summary
Updated the landing page (About page) to focus primarily on the sign-in option, with equipment visibility restricted to authenticated users only.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hero Section
**Before:** Standard hero with images and general CTA buttons
**After:** 
- Centered, prominent sign-in focused design
- Large tractor icon
- Clear message: "Sign in to browse available equipment in Thrissur villages"
- Primary "Sign In" button with secondary "Create Account" button
- Notice: "Equipment details and locations are visible only after signing in"

### 2. Stats Section → Why Sign In Section
**Before:** Displayed platform statistics (1200+ users, 234 equipment, etc.)
**After:**
- "Why Sign In?" heading
- Two benefit cards:
  - Browse Equipment: View all available equipment in Thrissur villages
  - Secure Bookings: Book equipment safely with verified operators
- Emphasizes value of authentication

### 3. Features Section
**Before:** 4 feature cards (Wide Equipment Range, Affordable Pricing, Quick Booking, Secure Payments)
**After:** **REMOVED** - Reduces information overload, focuses on authentication

### 4. How It Works Section
**Before:** Generic 3-step process (Browse, Book, Use)
**After:**
- Renamed to "Getting Started"
- Step 1: **Sign In** - Login or create account
- Step 2: **Browse Equipment** - View equipment with locations on map
- Step 3: **Book & Use** - Book and start using equipment
- First step explicitly requires authentication

### 5. CTA Section
**Before:** General "Ready to Get Started?" with equal emphasis on signup/login
**After:**
- Shield icon (security emphasis)
- Heading: "Sign In to Access Equipment"
- Subheading: "All equipment details, locations, and bookings are protected"
- Prominent "Sign In Now" button with shield icon
- Clear messaging about authentication requirement

## Security Implementation

### Backend (Already Configured)
✅ Equipment endpoints require authentication
✅ GET /equipment/** → requires JWT token
✅ Map data endpoints → requires authentication
✅ QR code endpoints → requires authentication

### Frontend Protection
✅ Equipment link in navigation → only visible when authenticated
✅ Map page → requires login to view equipment markers
✅ Equipment details → only accessible after sign-in
✅ Booking functionality → protected by authentication

## User Flow

1. **Landing Page (/)**
